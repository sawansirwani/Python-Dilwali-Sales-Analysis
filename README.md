# Diwali Sales Data Analysis 
This project explored a dataset containing customer information and sales details from a Diwali sale event. The key libraries used for analysis were pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Data Cleaning:

Missing values in the "Amount" column were identified and removed.
The data type of "Amount" was converted to integer for better calculations.
A typo in the column name "Martial_Status" was corrected to "Marital_Status".

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Customer demographics were analyzed, including gender, age group, marital status, state, zone, and occupation.
Sales performance was investigated by looking at total orders and total sales amount across different categories.
Key findings from the EDA:
Most orders and sales originated from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
Married women (especially in the 26-35 age group) were the primary customer segment with high purchasing power.
Customers working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors contributed significantly to sales.
Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories were the top sellers.
Specific product IDs were identified as the top sellers based on order count.
Conclusion:

The analysis suggests that married women aged 26-35 residing in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, are more likely to be high-spending customers during the Diwali sales. Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories emerged as the most popular product choices.

## Further Exploration:

Analyze the relationship between customer demographics and specific product categories.
Develop a model to predict customer buying behavior based on available features.
Investigate the impact of promotions and discounts on sales.
